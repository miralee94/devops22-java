## General

You can view markdown files in GitLab i.e this `README.md` will be visible on the page [devops21_java](https://gitlab.com/robert-alfwar/devops21_java).

You can preview markdown files in vscode with an extension i.e [markdown all in one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one). To open the preview mode, right click on the file and select `Open preview`.

If you have any improvements, guides or just better wording, feel free to create a `merge request` with the improvement to this repository.

## Lesson

Each lesson has its own folder that will be added alongside the course. In the lesson folder there are two types of markdown files, `LINK.md` and `EXERCISE.md`. A lesson may also contain script files, code or references to other repositories.

```bash
# To get the latest lesson & updates in master
git pull

# If you are in a branch you can rebase to get the latest content.
git fetch
git rebase origin/master
```

### Link

The `LINK.md` file contains what you need to solve the exercises and you can also find extra material to learn more. If you get stuck on an exercise, remember to check links for that lesson.

### Exercise

The `EXERCISE.md` file contains what you need to do and practice to succeed this course. Exercises with a `Hand in` instruction are mandatory and are needed to complete this course.

### Exercise - Hand in

The exercise `hand in` is done with a "Merge Request". If your merge request is closed by the teacher, you have successfully completed the exercise. This follows the UNIX Philosophy [no news is good news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AUnix_philosophy#No_news_is_good_news).
